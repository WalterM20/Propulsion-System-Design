# Automotive Propulsion System Design

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the analytical design and performance evaluation of a vehicle propulsion system. The study covers engine sizing, transmission matching, and fuel consumption analysis under various driving cycles.

## ⚙️ Key Modules
* **Engine Sizing:** Calculation of required power and torque based on vehicle dynamics (drag, rolling resistance, gradeability).
* **Transmission Design:** Selection of gear ratios to optimize acceleration performance and fuel economy.
* **Performance Analysis:**
    * Maximum speed and acceleration time (0-100 km/h).
    * Elasticity checks (e.g., 80-120 km/h in top gear).
* **Fuel Consumption:** Estimation of fuel efficiency over standard cycles (e.g., WLTP/NEDC) using BSFC maps.

## 💻 Methodology
* **Tools:** MATLAB / Excel / Analytical Calculation.
